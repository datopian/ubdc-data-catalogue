# Urban Big Data Centre - New Data Catalogue

## Objective

The objective is to commission the creation of a more fit for purpose data portal that will be at the forefront of UBDCâ€™s end user engagement. It will be the location that we will drive users towards, and where they should be able to learn all about our data, associated terms and conditions and data stories (e.g., interesting ways
that data are being used) and to request or obtain access, whether inline or downloaded for offline consumption. 
 
The portal will also promote and enable participation in community-building events related to one or more data collections. UBDC will use the portal to showcase and describe:
* their own open datasets, downloadable from the platform and where formats permit, viewable and capable of being explored inline
* their own / licensed safeguarded datasets, with details of access restrictions provided and processes for arranging data sharing embedded to some extent within the platform
* datasets from organisations with whom they have agreed to partner on metadata/data sharing and promotion
* other relevant datasets available elsewhere, identified and selected based on a defined policy
* content related to UBDC datasets, including but not limited to details of interesting uses of those data, additional explanatory materials, related visualisations / stories and information about related UBDC services.
